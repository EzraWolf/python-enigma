# python vigenere cipher

its as simple as 1, 2, 3.

1) Run the file and think of something to encrypt. Like "hello world"

2) Think of a key to encrypt the file in. Remember this for later when you want to decrypt the file too, because you'll need it.

3) Use that key and put "0" for encrypt, or "1" for decrypt. So if i wanted to re-read "hello world" after i encrypted it, i would need my special key i put in at the beginning.

PLEASE credit me for my work if you use this.
